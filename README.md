ClaySoldiersMod
===============
The Clay Soldiers mod is by SanAndreasP, Kodaichi, and SilverChiren.

This is a fork by CliffracerX, which will aim to readd some functions of the mod, as well as tweak a few things here and there.

To install, you need a non forge-gradle version of the SapManPack installed on your MCP, follow instructions on that repo.
Then, simply drop the assets and sanandreasp folder into your mcp/src/minecraft, and you're good to go!
